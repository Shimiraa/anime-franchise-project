# Inuyasha

An action-packed fantasy adventure by renowned author Rumiko Takahashi. Much like her old works Inuyasha is a long series that spawned multiple sidestories, seasons and even a full on sequel. Like most of Takahashi's works the original Inuyasha has received a full adaptation of its source material. The franchise consists of:
- 4 TV Anime
- 4 Movies
- 2 Specials

Of the specials, one is untranslated while the other is a crossover episode between Takahashi's series Ranma 1/2, Urusei Yatsura and Inuyasha. Both specials are included at the end of the order.
