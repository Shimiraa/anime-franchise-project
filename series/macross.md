# Macross

Originally inspired by Gundam the Macross Franchise is a Franchise that started as a passion project of the mecha fan club consisting of Shouji Kawamori, Hiroshi Oonogi and Haruhiko Mikimoto. They put their own twist on the Mecha genre mixing it with Music, specifically idols, being insanely important in the history of both genres.

There is multiple ways to approach this franchise with the "optimal" way to approach the franchise being to at least watch the original macross before watching any other entries. If you prefer not to watch older anime and are contempt with missing some references and maybe not fully understanding some core concepts realistically any Macross entry works as an entrypoint into the franchise.

## Synopsis

<div style="display: flex;">
    <div style="width: 70%;">
        In 1999, an alien spaceship crashes on South Ataria Island and makes the human race aware of other life in space. Ten years later, the ship is reconstructed and christened as the SDF-1 Macross. However, on the day of its maiden voyage, an alien race called the Zentradi make their appearance on Earth—thus beginning Space War I, a UN Spacy/Zentradi war that would change the history of both races forever. <span style="font-style: italic;">(Source: Anime News Network)</span>

## Order

In the Macross Franchise alternative versions are a common occurrance, most main entries in the franchise have movie alternatives that vary in how "different" they are to the original versions. In some cases they are just summaries / recuts of the original and in some cases they start off full on alternative timelines. Some really short entries showing off Fighter Designs and Music entries are excluded.

**My personal recommendation on how to tackle this franchise is the following:**

*If you want to experience Macross but aren't committed too much or have issues with older series:*<br>
--> Watch Frontier and the Delta Entries

*If you are willing to watch older shows and want to experience the original Macross but don't want to watch the entire franchise:*<br>
--> Watch the Original Series, (you can consider watching Zero here) then watch Frontier and the Delta Entries

*If you are willing to spend quite a bit of time into this franchise and are willing to watch older entries:*<br>
--> Give the entire franchise a shot! Not every entry is perfect, some may be disappointing but in the end most of the Macross entries are a lot of fun.

### Main Entries

*Note 1: The 'Main' entries are marked with bold names, if you want to only watch the mainline Macross realistically you can watch only these entries*<br>
*Note 2: [Macross Zero](https://anilist.co/anime/194/) is a prequel to the original Macross but should not be watched until AFTER finishing the original TV series*<br>
*Note 3: [Macross Flash Back 2012](https://anilist.co/anime/1504/) is a compilation of songs and scenes from both the TV Version of the original Macross and the Movie Do You Remember Love which is listed in the Alternative Timelines section*
