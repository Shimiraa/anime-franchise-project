# Brave Series

The Brave Series is a franchise started by Studio Sunrise in the early 90s. The series was an attempt of the studio to start a much lighter hearted franchise than the direction their other franchises like Gundam went during that time period. While shows like Gundam went a very brutal / death & destruction focused route, the brave series was intended to be a very light super hero franchise that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults. The series started with its first entry "Yuusha Exkaiser" in 1990 and spawned numerous long Mecha shows over the coming years.

## Synopsis (Exkaiser)

<div style="display: flex;">
    <div style="width: 70%;">
        A group of space police led by Exkaiser are chasing after the Geisters, an evil gang of treasure thieves. Upon arriving on Earth, Exkaiser and his team, the Kaisers, house their spirits into vehicles all over Japan to create physical bodies for their energy-based forms. Exkaiser inhabits a car belonging to the Hoshikawa family and befriends a third grade boy named Kouta Hoshikawa. Exkaiser and his allies must unite their powers in order to fight the Geisters and prevent them from stealing Earth's artifacts. <span style="font-style: italic;">(Source: Wikipedia)</span>

## Release Order

All big series in the Brave Series are unrelated to each other, meaning they can be watched completely unrelated to each other. The only cases where entries need to be watched in order is when they are part of the same part, for example GaoGaiGar and all subsequent GaoGaiGar entries.

*Note: Since most, if not all entries start with "Brave" in English or "Yuusha" in Japanese those parts are left out of the title*<br>
*Note 2: GaoGaiGar Final and GaoGaiGar Final Grand Glorious Gathering are the same stories as alternative versions*
*Note 3: In the GaoGaiGar Universe there is also another TV Series called [Betterman](https://anilist.co/anime/1136/) that is related to GaoGaiGar Final Project Z*
