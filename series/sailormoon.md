# Sailor Moon

Sailor Moon is probably to this day one of, if not the most popular Mahou Shoujo Franchise in Anime History. The original anime airing in 1992, the series has spanned over 30 years by now and is still releasing new entries even in the 2020s. In 2014 the Series got an alternative timeline/remake that has spawned multiple titles to this day. The Remake is a closer representation of the source material as it stays more truthful to it. (Note: The second part of Crystal is actually called Season 3 in english, as part 1 was split into 2 seasons)
