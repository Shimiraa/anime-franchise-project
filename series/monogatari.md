# Monogatari Series

The Monogatari Series is a light novel series by renowned author NISIOISIN, spanning over 10 anime series and 3 movies as of writing this document. The series can be split into 3 "seasons" each having multiple anime entries. Considering the not very straightforward timeline of Monogatari, the watchorder of this series is always a big discussion. Some people say you should watch the series in chronological order, some say you should watch them in release order. The **suggested watch-order** overall is the **release order**, as it also resembles the release order of the novels. This document includes the release order (moving Kizu), a semi-chronological watch order, meaning the full series at it's respective place in the chronological order and the series fully chronologically, meaning episode by episode as it plays in the series chronology (not recommended to watch it like this).

        The plot centers on Koyomi Araragi, a third-year high school student who survives a vampire attack and finds himself helping girls involved with a variety of apparitions, ghosts, beasts, spirits, and other supernatural phenomena, which often serve as proxies for their emotional and mental issues. <span style="font-style: italic;">(Source: Wikipedia)</span>
