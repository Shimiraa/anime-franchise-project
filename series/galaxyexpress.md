# Galaxy Express 999

Galaxy Express is one part of the Leijiverse, which is the universe of the creator Leiji Matsumoto. As with most of Leiji's works the entirety of the Galaxy Express Universe is only very losely connected, meaning this is rather a general collection of all the entries in release order, rather than a full on watch order. Some Series are direct prequels/sequels of each other but in general it makes the most sense to watch most of his works in the original release order. The Galaxy Express Universe does not only include all of the direct entries of Galaxy Express 999 but rather includes various space operas playing in the same world, such as Captain Harlock, Queen Millenia and many more.

## Synopsis

<div style="display: flex;">
    <div style="width: 70%;">
        In a distant future, Tetsuro is a human boy who wants his body replaced with a robotic one. This is possible, but to do so he has to reach the Immortal Planet onboard the space train Galaxy Express 999. Maetel, a beautiful and mysterious blonde woman dressed in Russian style, joins him in the long journey through space. Every episode sees our heroes arriving in a new planet's space train station. <span style="font-style: italic;">(Source: Anime News Network)</span>

## Order

*Note: Since Leiji has created stories with the idea of stories repeating itself Alternative entries like the Galaxy Express 999 Movie version are included in the normal list.*
<br>*Note 2: Since each entry can be watched on its own and each block is fully self-contained the episodes column is just used to show how many episodes the given entry has*
<br>*Note 3: The Riddle of the Arcadia Episode of Space Captain Harlock plays around episode 13 of Captain Harlock and aired after Episode 17*
