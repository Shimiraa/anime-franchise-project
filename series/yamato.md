# Space Battleship Yamato

Space Battleship Yamato, or also known as Star Blazers is a classic space opera by renowned author Leiji Matsumoto. Saying this series has shaped the japanese Sci-Fi scene would be heavily underselling reality. The impact this series had on the japanese Sci-Fi landscape is so huge, it is sometimes referred to as the japanese Star Wars. Matsumotos story has not only spawned multiple series in the 70s and 80s, but even a full on remake and now original story.

## Summary

<div style="display: flex;">
    <div style="width: 70%;">
        In the distant future, the war between the human race and the Gamilon has taken its toll on the planet Earth. Constant bombardment of radioactive asteroids has rendered the planet's atmosphere uninhabitable. As a means of relief aid, Queen Starsha of the planet Iscandar offers the Earth Forces a device that can completely neutalize the radiation off the planet. For this task, the space battleship Yamato is launched from the remains of its World War II ancestor on a 148,000 light-year journey. However, the crew of the Yamato has only one Earth year to travel to Iscandar and back, or the human race will come to an end. <span style="font-style: italic;">(Source: Anime News Network)</span>
