# Mobile Suit Gundam

Mobile Suit Gundam is one of the most influental sci-fi franchises in the history of japanese animation. It has completely redefined the mecha genre and shaped the future of the franchise for decades to come. It is hard to put the impact of this franchise into words, so we are gonna leave it at this short description. The franchise itself has spawned countless anime, manga, toys & games. Most anime series can be devided into set timelines, with the main timeline, the "canon" timeline being the **Universal Century**. 

Generally it is recommended to watch at least [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) before watching any other entries, but almost all Alternative Timelines are freely watchable on their own. There are some unconnected shorts like [Gundam EVOLVE](https://anilist.co/anime/3288/) or the [Gundam vs. Hello Kitty](https://anilist.co/anime/110419/) Spin-Off which aren't included in here.

All timelines:

- [Universal Century](#universal-century)
- [After Colony](#after-colony)
- [Cosmic Era](#cosmic-era)
- [Our Century / Current Century](#our-century--current-century)
- [One-shot Centuries](#one-shot-centuries)
  - [Future Century](#future-century)
  - [After War](#after-war)
  - [Anno Domini](#anno-domini)
  - [Advanced Generation](#advanced-generation)
  - [Regild Century](#regild-century)
  - [Post Disaster](#post-disaster)
  - [Ad Stella](#ad-stella)
- [Correct Century](#correct-century)

*Note: Since the entries should be watched individually the 'Episodes' column purely serves as an indicator for how long certain parts are*

## Universal Century

The Universal Century (short: U.C.) timeline of Gundam is ultimately considered to be the main parts of gundam. This is the central timeline and the main story. With the size of the Gundam franchise it comes to no surprise that not every single entry in the Universal Century is important to the main storyline. There is a lot of sidestories that at time don't even play remotely close to the main story. The Universal Century can be put into these orders:

- [Main Entries](#main-entries)
- [Chronological Order](#chronological-order)
- [Summary Entries](#summary-entries)

*Note: It is not included here but generally the [Correct Century](#correct-century) is seen as the finale of the Universal Century and although not confirmed it is theorized to play a few thousand years after the events of the Universal Century timeline*

### Main Entries

These are the main entries that **should** be watched if you want to watch the Universal Century timeline of gundam. Although not all of these parts start where the previous part ends they should be watched in order and no part should be skipped.

| **Type** | **Entry** | **Episodes** | **Start Date** | **U.C. Year** |
| :------- | :-------- | :----------- | -------------: | :------------ |
| TV    | [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/80/) | 43 | Apr 07 1979 | 0079 |
| TV    | [Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam](https://anilist.co/anime/85/) | 50 | Mar 02 1985 | 0087 |
| TV    | [Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ](https://anilist.co/anime/86/) | 47 | Mar 08 1986 | 0088 |
| Movie | [Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counter Attack](https://anilist.co/anime/87/) | 1 | Mar 12 1988 | 0093 |


<!-- omit in toc -->
### Chronological Order

This order puts all Universal Century entries into the order they play in chronologically, based on the U.C. Years. Main Parts and generally big / noteworthy parts are marked bold and with a (*). To keep the names shorter, the "Mobile Suit Gundam"-Part of each name is left out and in cases like Zeta or ZZ it will be turned into -> "Zeta Gundam" & "Double Zeta" to make it more clear which part is meant.

*Note: [Cucuruz Doan's Island (2022)](https://anilist.co/anime/139273/) is a modern retelling of the infamous episode 15 of the original Mobile Suit Gundam, which was removed out of the official english broadcast because of subpar animation.*
<br>*Note 2: In the case of Thunderbolt 1 & 2 most people prefer the alternative movie version, which are included under [Summary Entries](#summary-entries)*

### Summary Entries

## Correct Century

Theoretically the Correct Century falls under the one-shot century category, there is one key difference tho. It is theorized that the Correct Century is a continuation of the Universal Century thousands of years later. Many people see Turn A Gundam as the gundam that most resembles Yoshiyuki Tomino's ideology and it is generally recommended not to watch this part early on, but rather watch a few other Tomino Gundam Series (or if you want to go to extreme lengths: as many as possible) before watching this part, as this is a culmination of gundam themes and ideas.
