# Series Watch Orders

This is a project made and maintained as a small sideproject. Whenever I come across a long series with many many entries, you run into the question of "in what order do I watch these" or how do you even approach large series. My personal approach has always been to go by the release date unless there is a valid argument for any other order, so this project is supposed to help with exactly that. These lists summarize all entries (unless something isn't findable/available) of certain franchises and put them either into release order or in the order that makes the most sense to watch them.

Currently documented franchises:

- [Detective Conan](./series/conan.md)
- [Galaxy Express 999](./series/galaxyexpress.md)
- [Inuyasha](./series/inuyasha.md)
- [Mobile Suit Gundam](./series/gundam.md)
- [Monogatari Series](./series/monogatari.md)
- [Rurouni Kenshin](./series/rurouni.md)
- [Sailor Moon](./series/sailormoon.md)
- [Slayers](./series/slayers.md)
